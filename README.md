# What is this
My first project during the Technigo bootcamp. 
Assignment: **Make a responsive news site**.
## How I started
I started by doing the Noops code-along and going through the rest of the course material of week 2. After that I pretty much just started coding, I didn't make a drawn sketch of my website before I started coding. Doing a sketch before starting with the code would have saved me quite a few hours of work.  
### What I struggled with and should improve for next weeks project
I did struggle with just about everything in the beginning. But after a while I felt rather confident. 

I did have issues with code structure. I started with the header and that code is pretty messy, so is the "big news"-code. But the "small news"-code is pretty well structured. That's the order I did them in, so you can tell that during this week I improved my code structure quite a lot. 

I couldn't manage to figure out how to center items in a container when the children inside it where "flex-wraped". I tried so many things, but I just couldn't. Thats something I really want to learn. 

I should have done a better sketch of the site and not just used the one in the project folder. It's clear now that drawing a web site design would have helped me a lot when figuring out how many different containers different parts of the site would need. 

### What I'm proud of
Honestly, all of it! I have had so many tabs up at once on my computer. I've googled and googled. But I have managed do this by myself, it's not the prettiest design in the world. But it's mine, and it works. 

### If I had more time
I would make a footer and add different images for the small news cards.
